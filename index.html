                    <h3>USER RESEARCH</h3>
                    <p>Using quantitative and qualitative research methods, such as surveys, interviews, and available statistical information, I hope to  discover, drive, and choose new directions and opportunities for the products I work with.</p>

                    <h3>USER EMPATHY</h3>
                    <p>Empathy and compassion are key throughout the whole design process. I put this into practice by creating user personas, empathy maps, and practicing sincere observation and listening skills during user interviews. This a skill I most recently had to apply as I learned to do video call interviews.</p>

                    <h3>QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS</h3>
                    <p>Planning an interview is just as important as conducting the interview itself. I think of the interview as a research study and a clear goal/s needs to be set for the results to be fruitful. Most importantly, I also strive to make the user as comfortable as possible by creating a natural rapport and guiding them through the process</p>
